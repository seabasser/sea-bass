# CBaaS (Cheap Booze as a Service)

You've arrived at the repo for the backend for the CBaaS service.

# Getting Started

This project uses pipenv to manage its dependencies.
[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install/manage the appropriate python (currently 3.8.x), pip 
and pipenv version. Once you have pipenv, do the following:

```
pipenv install --dev
```

Afterwards you can activate the virtual environment by running:

```
pipenv shell
```

You can then run the app locally by running:

```
python run.py
```
